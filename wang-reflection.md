# 1.1 GPS Reflection 

1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

   Answer: I think I did not figure it out how git works when committing changes to repo. Firstly, I create a git local database and create a new file in the same directory so that I can commit the change to git. When we did GPS, we could not push the changes to repo because we did not create files under the correct directory.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

   Answer: How git works correctly and how to avoid the merge error. Also we figured out how to avoid the merge conflict during the GPS. We both learned much we missed last week.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

   Answer: First is how to find my pair's github and clone from his repo. Second, does other people who are contributors make pull request when I push the change to repo.

4. What still confuses you about git?

   Answer: I think git command has a lot of argument and I need take time to read them and practice.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

   Answer: In the beginning, I felt a little bit nervous. But when we went through several steps coping with eath other, I felt relaxed and the learning environment is good for new programmers to grasp the knowledge and find their shortages.
