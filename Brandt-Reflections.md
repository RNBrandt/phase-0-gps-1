##What Git concepts was I struggling with prior to the GPS session.

I am a conceptual learner, so I have a lot of trouble when I'm given a set of directions without background as to why each direction works the way it does.  So the way it seems we've learned is do this and it works. I had trouble, however, because at some point it didn't, and I didn't have the theory to figure out why it didn't work. So I think I could use more information about what EXACTLY git is and HOW EXACTLY it works, especially with regard to the interaction between Git and GitHub.

## What concepts were clarified during the GPS.

The reason you need to create a repository is that it codes the file with git, as a tag so git knows what to do. That means you can move a file and Git will keep track of it.  Similarly, if you're not exactly where you think you are, or need to be, Git will have no idea what to do with your commands.

## What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

Why isn't this working, and what am I doing wrong?

## What still confuses me about Git.

At the moment that I'm working on this I'm taking a break from a frustrating time with my main Git directory, so apparently quite a lot!

## How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great, once we relaxed and found the best way for each of us to communicate it went really well!
